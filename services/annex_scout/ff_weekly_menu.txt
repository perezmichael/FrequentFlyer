**Notes:**

*   I've prioritized events that offer a clear visual hook for Instagram. Events like "speed dating" might be great in person, but harder to represent visually.
*   Venues are diversified to showcase a range of neighborhoods.
*   I've tried to balance event types (music, comedy, food, community) to appeal to a wider audience.
*   The captions are punchy, lowercase, and alternative to match the "Frequent Flyer" vibe. Remember to use high-quality images or videos!
*   I removed the "Krampus Rumpus" events that are "CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC" since they would not be relevant or accessible to the audience.
*   Sorted by score, then recency.
