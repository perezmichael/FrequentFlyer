# Frequent Flyer: The Soul of the Eastside

## Our Identity
We are the alternative pulse of Los Angeles. We prioritize events that feel like a vinyl listening room, or a grassroots art market.

## Aesthetic Pillars
1. **Analog & Tactile:** We love vinyl-only sets, zine releases, and hand-drawn flyers.
2. **Multi-Performance:** A 10/10 event involves an intersection (Food + Music + Community).
3. **Niche & Alternative:** Goth nights, synthwave, ambient sets, and "underground" pop-ups.

## Geographical North Star
Focus on Eastside hoods: Los Feliz (Home), Hollywood,Lincoln Heights, Echo Park, Silver Lake, Highland Park, DTLA, and Koreatown.
